IMPORTANT:** Review only the one context. Do NOT evaluate any context from the contextlist. Your decision should consider the overall context provided by the entire set.

Guidelines for evaluation:
1. A context is "Relevant" ONLY if it contains a critical, indispensable detail necessary to build the complete answer. Omission of such a context would leave the answer incomplete or ambiguous.
2. A context is "Not Relevant" if it only provides peripheral, background, or general context that does not directly contribute to a complete answer.
3. Use EXACTLY the words "Relevant" or "Not Relevant" for each context—no extra commentary or explanations.
4. Respond with **"Relevant"** or **"Not Relevant"**

Now evaluate this context:
Lee Mi-sook (born April 2, 1960) is a South Korean actress. One of the best-known actresses of 1980s Korean cinema, Lee's most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's \"Whale Hunting\" and \"The Winter That Year Was Warm\", Lee Doo-yong's \"Mulberry\" and \"Eunuch\", and Kwak Ji-kyoon's \"Wanderer in Winter\". She retired from film after getting married in 1987, though she still appeared on television in dramas such as \"How's Your Husband?\" (1993). Then a decade later, Lee made her comeback with an award-winning leading role in E J-yong's feature debut \"An Affair\" (1998). She has since remained active in film and television, notably in the May–December romance \"Solitude\" (2002), the \"Dangerous Liaisons\" adaptation \"Untold Scandal\" (2003), the mockumentary \"Actresses\" (2009), and the family dramas \"Smile, Mom\" (2010)
